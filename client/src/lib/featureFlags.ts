/**
 * Single feature-flag config for the beta, per clover-feature-exposure-rules.md.
 *
 * Three tiers:
 *  - Core: the golden path itself — always on, present in onboarding and as
 *    the home screen's dominant CTA.
 *  - Peripheral: built and working, but not under test. The flag being `true`
 *    does NOT grant placement — Peripheral features must stay out of
 *    onboarding, primary nav, and the dominant CTA area, and must not emit
 *    notifications/prompts. Placement is enforced in the components (see the
 *    nav structure in Home.tsx), not by this file.
 *  - Beta-Gated: not ready. Fully off — nav entries removed AND content
 *    render-gated, so a stray state change or deep link can't reach them.
 *    No usage data may be generated for these while off.
